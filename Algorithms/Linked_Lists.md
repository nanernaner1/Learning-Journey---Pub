## Linked Lists

Linked Lists are a form of data structure that are 1 way to structure data rather than typical 'ready-to-use' builtin data structures because of how they manage data and their operations. The typical way isn't as efficient and therefore isn't as scalable when requiring to use across large sets of data to perform operations such as Search, Modify, Delete, Create.

They are called 'linked lists because they take advantage of an object's ability to utilize instance variables that 'link' or 'point' to another object.

The main objects in a linked list are `head` and `tail`. Other methods are created such as `size`, `insert`, `search`, `delete` among others.

### Singly Linked Lists

These are lists with objects that contain a single pointer that start from the `head` and work their way towards the `tail`. This solely uses `next` to point to the next object, but refrains from using `prev` for previous.

### Doubly Linked Lists

These are lists that have objects with pointers

## Questions

1. What use-case could there be where a `singly-linked-list` is better to use than a `doubly-linked-list`?
