To write a script that uses Microsoft's Graph API to connect to your session of Teams and post a message to a specific person or Team, you would need the following:

1. **Microsoft Teams Account**: You need a Microsoft Teams account with a valid subscription⁴.

2. **Registered App in Azure Active Directory**: You need to register an application in Azure Active Directory⁴. This registered app will be used to authenticate and authorize your script's access to the Microsoft Graph API³.

3. **Required Permissions**: Your registered app needs to have the necessary permissions to send messages via Teams¹. For sending a message in a channel, the permissions required are `ChannelMessage.Send`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`¹. For sending a message in a chat, the permissions required are `ChatMessage.Send`, `Chat.ReadWrite`¹.

4. **Microsoft Graph SDK**: It's recommended to have the Microsoft Graph SDK installed in your development environment⁴. This SDK provides methods for interacting with the Microsoft Graph API and simplifies the process of making requests.

5. **Access Token**: You need to acquire an access token that will be used to authenticate your requests to the Microsoft Graph API³. This token can be obtained using the credentials of your registered app.

6. **User ID**: You need the User ID of each person you want to include in the chat³. This can be obtained using the Microsoft Graph API.

7. **HTTP Requests**: You will be making HTTP POST requests to send messages. The endpoints for these requests will depend on whether you're sending a message in a channel or in a chat¹.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the exact implementation will depend on your specific use case and development environment. Always refer to the official Microsoft documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
