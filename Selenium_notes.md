In Selenium with Python, you can retrieve the URLs for all the open tabs using the `window_handles` attribute of the WebDriver object. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Start the WebDriver (replace 'your_driver_path' with the path to your driver)
driver = webdriver.Chrome('your_driver_path')

# Open some tabs
driver.get('http://example.com')
driver.execute_script("window.open('http://example.org');")

# Get the URLs of all open tabs
urls = [driver.switch_to.window(handle).current_url for handle in driver.window_handles]

# Print the URLs
for url in urls:
    print(url)
```

In this code:
- `driver.window_handles` returns a list of handles for all the open tabs. Each handle is a unique identifier for a tab.
- `driver.switch_to.window(handle)` switches the driver's focus to the tab with the given handle.
- `driver.current_url` returns the URL of the currently focused tab.

This script will print the URLs of all open tabs. Please replace `'your_driver_path'` with the path to your WebDriver executable.

Remember that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to control the browser with Selenium. If you encounter any issues, make sure you're using the correct WebDriver and that it's correctly installed and configured.

I am trying to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list such that each element at index i of the new list is the product of all the numbers in the original list except the one at i. For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]. I am not allowed to use division. How can I do this?

Sure, I can help with that. Here's a Python function that accomplishes this using two passes through the list:

```python
def get_products(nums):
    # Initialize a list of the same length as nums with all values as 1
    products = [1 for _ in nums]

    # In the first pass, calculate the product of all numbers to the left of each number
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        products[i] *= left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]

    # In the second pass, calculate the product of all numbers to the right of each number
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        products[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]

    return products
```

In this function:
- The first `for` loop calculates the product of all numbers to the left of each number in `nums` and stores it in `products`.
- The second `for` loop calculates the product of all numbers to the right of each number in `nums` and multiplies it with the corresponding value in `products`.

This function does not use division and runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input list.

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_products(nums))  # Output: [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]

nums = [3, 2, 1]
print(get_products(nums))  # Output: [2, 3, 6]
```
