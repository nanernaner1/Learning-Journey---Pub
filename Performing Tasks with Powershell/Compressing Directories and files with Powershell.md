To compress your project directory into a `.zip` file using PowerShell, you can use the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open PowerShell.

2. Navigate to the parent directory of your project directory. If your project directory is at `C:\Users\YourName\YourProject`, you would navigate to `C:\Users\YourName`:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName
```

3. Use the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet to create a `.zip` file of your project directory:

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path .\YourProject -DestinationPath .\YourProject.zip
```

This will create a `YourProject.zip` file in the same directory.

Please replace `C:\Users\YourName` and `YourProject` with your actual directory path and project name.

Once the `.zip` file is created, you can share it with your users. They can then extract the `.zip` file and install your package by running `pip install .` in the directory containing the `setup.py` file.

To exclude a directory or file from being compressed in PowerShell, you can use the `-Exclude` parameter of the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to specify the files or directories you want to exclude¹³⁴. Here's an example:

```powershell
# target path
$path = "C:\\YourProject"

# construct archive path
$DateTime = (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss")
$destination = Join-Path $path "ARCHIVE\\archive-$DateTime.zip"

# exclusion rules. Can use wild cards (*)
$exclude = @("exclude_dir", "exclude_file")

# get files to compress using exclusion filter
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Exclude $exclude -Recurse

# compress
Compress-Archive -Path $files.FullName -DestinationPath $destination -CompressionLevel Fastest
```

In this script, replace `"C:\\YourProject"`, `"exclude_dir"`, and `"exclude_file"` with your actual directory path, directory name, and file name you want to exclude.

This script will create a zip file of the `YourProject` directory, excluding the specified directory and file. The `-Recurse` parameter is used with `Get-ChildItem` to get items in all child containers¹.

Please note that the `-Exclude` parameter only applies to the name of the final element in the path (the file or directory name), not the entire path¹. If you need more complex exclusion rules, you might need to use additional cmdlets or scripts¹.
