# Packages

#### This article is an ongoing list of packages I am familiar with or would like to know more about. It is to document my use of 3rd party packages in case I would ever like to check back on packages I have used or would like to explore again.

### Purpose

I wrote this because I don't want to keep searching the web for something I already have performed a websearch on before. I don't want to go down rabbit holes and end up at the same solution as I once did already before. I'd rather skip the rabbit holes when possible.
