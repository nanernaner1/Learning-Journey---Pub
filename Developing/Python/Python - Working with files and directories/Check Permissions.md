In Python, you can use the `os` module to check and print the permissions of a file. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import os
import stat

# Create a temporary file
tempfile = open("tempfile.txt", "w")
tempfile.close()

# Get the permissions
mode = os.stat("tempfile.txt").st_mode

# Print the permissions
print(f"Permissions: {stat.filemode(mode)}")

# Change the permissions
os.chmod("tempfile.txt", mode | stat.S_IWUSR)
```

In this code:

- `os.stat("tempfile.txt").st_mode` gets the permissions of the file.
- `stat.filemode(mode)` converts the permissions to a string that can be printed.
- `os.chmod("tempfile.txt", mode | stat.S_IWUSR)` changes the permissions of the file to add write permissions for the user.

Please note that this code might not work as expected on Windows due to differences in how permissions are handled on different operating systems. If you're working on Windows, you might need to use a module like `pywin32` to work with file permissions. Also, please be careful when changing file permissions to avoid creating security risks. Always make sure to understand the implications of the changes you're making.

If you want to resolve permissions (i.e., if you want to ensure that a certain permission is set), you can use the bitwise OR operator (`|`) with the current permissions and the permission you want to ensure is set. In the example above, `stat.S_IWUSR` is the permission for the user to write to the file. If this permission is not already set, the `os.chmod()` call will set it. If it is already set, the call will leave it as it is.

This is a basic example and might not cover all cases. Depending on your specific needs, you might need to adjust this code. For example, you might need to handle errors or check for the existence of the file before trying to change its permissions. Always make sure to test your code thoroughly and handle all possible edge cases.

Remember to replace `"tempfile.txt"` with the path to your actual temporary file.
