### Me:

Am I understanding this wrong? Why does the MemoryStoreBase contains methods that just use "pass" instead of any actual logic? Does it have something to do with "abstractmethod" decorator being used? It looks like these are just placeholders for future implementations. Please elaborate on the practice and reason these 'pass' statements exist.

### GitHub Copilot:

Yes, you're correct. The MemoryStoreBase class is an abstract base class (ABC), as indicated by the ABC in its inheritance list. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed by other classes.

The abstractmethod decorator is used to declare abstract methods in this ABC. An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class but doesn't contain any implementation. Subclasses of the ABC are generally expected to provide an implementation for these methods.

The pass keyword in Python is a placeholder and doesn't do anything. It's used here because Python syntax requires that there be something in the body of the method. Without pass, there would be a syntax error.

This is a common practice when you want to design a base class where some methods are common and implemented, but others are left for the subclasses to implement. This way, you can ensure that all subclasses will have a certain interface or behavior.

Can you provide an example of how this might be used? Use a simple example so as to get the point across. Maybe something like an example that defines animals and sublcasses something relevant. The goal is to explain @abstractmethod and why there isn't any logic due to the subclass activity that is expected.

GitHub Copilot
Sure, let's consider a simple example of an abstract base class for animals. We'll define some methods that we expect all animals to have, but we won't provide any implementation for them in the base class. Instead, we'll leave it up to the subclasses to provide the implementation.

Here's the abstract base class:

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def move(self):
        pass
```

In this case, Animal is an abstract base class and make_sound and move are abstract methods. We can't create an instance of Animal because it's an abstract base class. We also can't call make_sound or move on an Animal because these methods don't have any implementation.

Now, let's define some subclasses of Animal:

```
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

    def move(self):
        return "Runs on four legs"

class Bird(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Chirp!"

    def move(self):
        return "Flies in the sky"
```

In these subclasses, we provide the implementation for the abstract methods. Now we can create instances of Dog and Bird and call the methods on them:

```
dog = Dog()
print(dog.make_sound())  # Outputs: Woof!
print(dog.move())  # Outputs: Runs on four legs

bird = Bird()
print(bird.make_sound())  # Outputs: Chirp!
print(bird.move())  # Outputs: Flies in the sky
```

This is the essence of the abstractmethod decorator and abstract base classes. They allow you to define a common interface for a group of related classes, and ensure that all subclasses will have a certain set of methods.

### Discussing the term 'Supersede' and whether it ever relates to OOP

## Me:

I've heard the term supersede. Is that what describes a Base Class's relationship to a subclass?

## Github Copilot

No, the term "supersede" is not typically used to describe the relationship between a base class and a subclass. In object-oriented programming, we usually use the terms "inheritance" and "subclassing".

A subclass "inherits" from a base class (also known as a superclass), meaning it gets all the methods and attributes of the base class. The subclass can then add new methods or attributes, or "override" the methods of the base class to provide a different implementation.

So, in a way, a subclass can "override" methods of the base class, but we don't usually say it "supersedes" the base class. The base class still exists and can be used on its own or to create other subclasses.

## Me:

So we also don't say "base class supersedes the subclass"?

## Github Copilot

Correct, we don't say "base class supersedes the subclass" either. The term "supersede" generally means to replace something in power, effectiveness, use, etc. In the context of object-oriented programming, neither the base class nor the subclass replaces or supersedes the other.

Instead, they have a parent-child relationship. The base class (parent) defines a common structure and behavior that the subclass (child) inherits. The subclass can then extend or override this behavior as needed. Both the base class and subclass have their own roles and neither one replaces or supersedes the other.

## Me:

Is the term 'supersede' used anywhere within the context of object-oriented programming?

## Github Copilot

The term "supersede" is not commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming. The more common terms are "inheritance", "subclassing", "overriding", and "extending".

"Inheritance" is when a class (the subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (the superclass or base class).

"Subclassing" is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.

"Overriding" is when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.

"Extending" is when a subclass adds new methods or properties that were not present in its superclass.

While a subclass can override or extend the functionality of its superclass, it doesn't "supersede" it in the sense of replacing it completely. The superclass still exists and can be used to create other subclasses.
