Would the following script be able to get any insight into dropped packets?

echo "Enter Start date in double digit format"; read startdate; echo "Enter End date"; read enddate;echo "Enter Network Device";read ndevice;printf "%-16s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s\n" "Day " " IFACE " " rxpck/s " " txpck/s " " rxkB/s " " txkB/s " " rxcmp/s " " txcmp/s " " rxmcst/s " ;for ((x=startdate; x<=enddate; x++)); do formatted_x=$(printf "%02d" "${x}"); msg=$(sar -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa${formatted_x} | grep ${ndevice} | grep 'Average:');printf "%-16s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s\n" "${formatted_x} ${msg}";done

The script you've provided is using the `sar` command to report network statistics from a specified range of dates for a given network device. The `sar -n DEV` command provides information about network devices, including packets received (`rxpck/s`), packets transmitted (`txpck/s`), kilobytes received per second (`rxkB/s`), kilobytes transmitted per second (`txkB/s`), compressed packets received (`rxcmp/s`), compressed packets transmitted (`txcmp/s`), and multicast packets received (`rxmcst/s`).

However, this script does not directly provide information about dropped packets. To get information about dropped packets, you would need to use the `sar -n EDEV` command instead of `sar -n DEV`. The `EDEV` option reports network error statistics, including statistics on dropped packets.

Here's how you might modify the script to report on dropped packets:

```bash
echo "Enter Start date in double digit format"; read startdate; echo "Enter End date"; read enddate;echo "Enter Network Device";read ndevice;printf "%-16s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s\n" "Day " " IFACE " " rxerr/s " " txerr/s " " coll/s " " rxdrop/s " " txdrop/s " " txcarr/s " " rxfram/s " ;for ((x=startdate; x<=enddate; x++)); do formatted_x=$(printf "%02d" "${x}"); msg=$(sar -n EDEV -f /var/log/sa/sa${formatted_x} | grep ${ndevice} | grep 'Average:');printf "%-16s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s %-3s\n" "${formatted_x} ${msg}";done
```

This script now reports on network errors, including dropped packets received (`rxdrop/s`) and dropped packets transmitted (`txdrop/s`).

Please note that the `sar` command reads from system activity files (`/var/log/sa/saNN`) which are generated by the `sysstat` package. These files are typically generated daily, so you can specify the day of the month (in double digit format) to read the statistics for a particular day. If these files are not available, or if the `sysstat` package is not installed or not configured to collect network statistics, the `sar` command may not provide the expected output. Also, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the system activity files. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Is there a better way to retrieve this information via Bash or Python?

Bing:
Yes, there are several ways to retrieve network statistics using both Bash and Python. Here are a few examples:

**Bash:**
The `netstat` command can be used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. For example, to print statistics for all sockets and interfaces, you can use:

```bash
netstat -s
```

The `ss` command is another powerful tool to investigate sockets, and it can display more information than `netstat` if used with the `-e` (extended) option:

```bash
ss -e
```

**Python:**
In Python, you can use the `psutil` library to get network statistics. Here's a simple script that prints some network stats:

```python
import psutil

# Get net io counters
net_io_counters = psutil.net_io_counters(pernic=True)

for nic, stats in net_io_counters.items():
    print(f"{nic}:")
    print(f"\tBytes sent: {stats.bytes_sent}")
    print(f"\tBytes received: {stats.bytes_recv}")
    print(f"\tPackets sent: {stats.packets_sent}")
    print(f"\tPackets received: {stats.packets_recv}")
    print(f"\tError in: {stats.errin}")
    print(f"\tError out: {stats.errout}")
    print(f"\tDrop in: {stats.dropin}")
    print(f"\tDrop out: {stats.dropout}")
```

This script prints the number of bytes and packets sent and received, as well as the number of errors and dropped packets, for each network interface.

Please note that these methods provide general network statistics and may not provide the exact same information as the `sar` command in your original script. Also, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands or scripts, and that you're following best practices for security. Let me know if you have any other questions!
