Using Powershell, how might I check DNS Resolver in Windows?

You can use the `Resolve-DnsName` cmdlet in PowerShell to check the DNS resolver. Here's a simple example:

```powershell
# Replace 'www.example.com' with the domain you want to check
Resolve-DnsName -Name "www.example.com"
```

This command will return a variety of information about the domain, including its IP address, record type, and TTL (Time To Live).

Please note that you might need to run PowerShell as an administrator to use the `Resolve-DnsName` cmdlet. If you encounter any issues, make sure your execution policy allows you to run scripts. You can check your execution policy by using `Get-ExecutionPolicy`, and set it to RemoteSigned or Unrestricted using `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.

Remember, changing the execution policy might expose your system to potential security risks. Always be cautious when modifying system settings.

How can I check for any other hostnames that are configured in the local DNS for a Windows and a Linux host?

To check for other hostnames configured in the local DNS for a Windows host, you can use the `nslookup` command in the Command Prompt. Here's an example:

```cmd
nslookup
> set type=any
> localhost
```

This will return all DNS records for the localhost.

For a Linux host, you can use the `dig` command. Here's an example:

```bash
dig localhost ANY
```

This will return all DNS records for the localhost.

Please replace 'localhost' with the hostname you want to check. Also, please note that these commands might not return other hostnames if your system is not configured as a DNS server. If you want to find all the hostnames of the machines in your network, you might need to check the configuration of your actual DNS server.
