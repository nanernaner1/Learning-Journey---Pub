# Learning Journey

This is a collection of notes during my personal journey into learning various disciplines and topics across my career in Information Technology.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this document is to provide myself something to look back on and use as my own reference. Attempting to perform web searches across the internet to revisit past topics and pages that I've already searched is a tedious and cumbersome task. I'd like to think that whatever I have researched in the past, I managed to reach 'some' type of conclusion, even if that meant I didn't get the answer I was expecting. This can serve as my own personal 'stopping point'.
