Plugin Ideas

- Read, analyze, determine if changes can be made to improve, provide changes.
- Take input to perform the same 4 step process above, then integrate this into the existing script. This will help a user to add more details while keeping the ability to include the pre-processing by the plugin in case the user forgets to include other details.
    - Example:
        1. User tells it to read, analyze, determine, and generate change edits.
        2. SK provides the response with the edits.
        3. User realizes they forget to add other details and wants to integrate it into the response they were already given.
        4. SK takes the new input, performs Step 1 on the new input, integrates it into the previous response, then finally provides the new full response with the new changes.
- Generate "How to install" for the author's target user so their target user knows how to install and setup the author's application.
- Generate steps for the author on how to package the author's code to include with the README.md / ADO page.
    - Receive input from the author that includes the preferred scripting language for SK to help and generate code for the author to run.
