IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language that is tightly integrated with .NET. IronPython can use .NET and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily. IronPython is written entirely in C#, although some of its code is automatically generated by a code generator written in Python. IronPython is implemented on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), a library that provides dynamic typing and dynamic method dispatch for dynamic languages.
IronPython was created by Jim Hugunin and the CLR team at Microsoft, and is currently maintained by a group of volunteers at GitHub. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">It is free and open-source software, and can be implemented with Python Tools for Visual Studio, which is a free and open-source extension for Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE</a>.
IronPython has many advantages over other Python implementations, such as:

- It runs on the .NET Framework and Mono, which are widely used platforms for developing applications.
- It supports an interactive console with fully dynamic compilation, which allows you to write and execute Python code without saving it to disk.
- It has a rich set of built-in types and features, such as classes, exceptions, generators, decorators, comprehensions, lambda expressions, etc.
- It can interoperate with other .NET languages, such as C#, VB.NET, F#, etc., using dynamic proxies or reflection.
- It can access .NET libraries and resources using the clr module or the clr.AddReference method.
- It can use third-party libraries written in C# or other languages using the clr.AddReference method or the clr.GetClrType method.
