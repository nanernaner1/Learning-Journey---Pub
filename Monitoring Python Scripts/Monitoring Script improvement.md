Great. I think it's working. but now the following function to only print if the value changes, otherwise don't print anything.

```python
def monitor_resources():
    # Get the process ID of the current process
    pid = os.getpid()

    # Create a Process object
    p = psutil.Process(pid)

    # Get the CPU usage of the process
    cpu_usage = p.cpu_percent(interval=1)

    # Get the memory usage of the process
    memory_usage = p.memory_percent()

    print(f"CPU usage of the process: {cpu_usage}%")
    print(f"Memory usage of the process: {memory_usage}%")
```

This will be imported into another script. Are there ways to improve the script?

Yes, there are a few ways to improve the script:

1. **Encapsulate the global variables in a class**: Global variables can lead to code that's difficult to debug and maintain. Instead, you could encapsulate the variables in a class. Here's an example:

```python
import os
import psutil

class ResourceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prev_cpu_usage = None
        self.prev_memory_usage = None

    def monitor_resources(self):
        # Get the process ID of the current process
        pid = os.getpid()

        # Create a Process object
        p = psutil.Process(pid)

        # Get the CPU usage of the process
        cpu_usage = p.cpu_percent(interval=1)

        # Get the memory usage of the process
        memory_usage = p.memory_percent()

        # Only print CPU usage if it has changed
        if cpu_usage != self.prev_cpu_usage:
            print(f"CPU usage of the process: {cpu_usage}%")
            self.prev_cpu_usage = cpu_usage

        # Only print memory usage if it has changed
        if memory_usage != self.prev_memory_usage:
            print(f"Memory usage of the process: {memory_usage}%")
            self.prev_memory_usage = memory_usage
```

2. **Handle potential exceptions**: The `psutil.Process(pid)` call might raise a `psutil.NoSuchProcess` exception if the process doesn't exist. You could add a try/except block to handle this.

3. **Avoid hardcoding the interval**: Instead of hardcoding the interval for `cpu_percent(interval=1)`, you could make it a parameter of your function or method. This would make your code more flexible.

4. **Logging instead of printing**: If this script is going to be running for a long time, it might be better to use logging instead of print statements. This way, you can have a record of the resource usage over time, which can be useful for debugging and performance tuning.

I hope these suggestions help! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š

Give me an example of how to use it as I import it into another script such as the monitor_alarms.py script.

Your code would replace the `monitor_resources()` function in the `ResourceMonitor` class. Here's an example:

```python
import os
import psutil
import json

class ResourceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prev_cpu_usage = None
        self.prev_memory_usage = None

    def monitor_resources(self):
        # Get the process ID of the current process
        pid = os.getpid()

        # Create a Process object
        p = psutil.Process(pid)

        # Get the CPU usage of the process
        cpu_usage = p.cpu_percent(interval=1)

        # Get the memory usage of the process
        memory_usage = p.memory_percent()

        # Only print CPU usage if it has changed
        if cpu_usage != self.prev_cpu_usage:
            print(f"CPU usage of the process: {cpu_usage}%")
            self.prev_cpu_usage = cpu_usage

        # Only print memory usage if it has changed
        if memory_usage != self.prev_memory_usage:
            print(f"Memory usage of the process: {memory_usage}%")
            self.prev_memory_usage = memory_usage
```

You can save this code in a Python file, for example `resource_monitor.py`. Then, in your `monitor_alarms.py` script, you can import and use the `ResourceMonitor` class like this:

```python
from resource_monitor import ResourceMonitor

# Create an instance of ResourceMonitor
monitor = ResourceMonitor()

# Use the monitor_resources method in a loop
while True:
    monitor.monitor_resources()
    # Your monitor_alarms code goes here
```

In this example, replace `# Your monitor_alarms code goes here` with the code you want to run in the loop. This could be the code that checks the alarms, for example. I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
